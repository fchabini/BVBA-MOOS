# BVBA-MOOS
# Deploy Active directory with DSC.
# 
# The idea is to write a script that will install a active doamin controller with some features and roles as DHCP role and A Dns role. 
# create some shared files for all our departments and make sure they are also visible in our network 
# our DHCP needs to have a scope and be able to distribute ip addresses to joined clients 
# all of this of course can only be achievable with a static ip that our DSC script needs to setup automatically 
# we need also to create a webserver with a welcome page throuhg index.html

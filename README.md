# BVBA-MOOS
# Active directory with DSC.
# the idea is to write a script for Ken where our Server 2016 should have a domain controller installed as well 
# as DHCP role and A Dns role. 
# create some shared files for all our departments and make sure they are also visible in our network 
# our DHCP needs to have a scope and be able to distribute ip addresses to joined clients 
# all of this of course can only be achievable with a static ip that our DSC script needs to setup automatically 
# we need also to create a webserver with a welcome page throuhg index.html
